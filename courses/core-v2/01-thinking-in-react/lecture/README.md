# Thinking in React

# Main Topics to Cover

- ✅ Dive into JSX and the mechanics of React
- ✅ JSX is function calls, props are arguments

- ✅ Terms: Element vs Component
- ✅ How React embraces composability
- ✅ The declarative approach to React
- ✅ Mapping over data in JSX, key prop

# Lecture

Some points the instructor can touch on:

- Explain how JSX compiles into `React.createElement` or `_jsx` with Babel
- We like React because it's declarative (explain this vs imperative)
- We like React because it's composable (demonstrate re-usability with components)
- JSX allows for embedding JS expressions
- Some DOM props are different than HTML - className not class - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/className

NOTE: Buttons are stripped of style when just doing `<button>`. Add a class of "button" to make it look like a button.
