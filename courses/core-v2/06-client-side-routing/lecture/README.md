# Client Side Routing & Single Page Applications (SPA)

# Main Topics to Cover

The main point is to familiarize them with Client Side Routing so they can understand the basics enough to understand SPAs and to be successful with the rest of the curriculum -- not necessarily to spend tons of time making them React Router experts.

- ✅ Single Page Applications
- ✅ React Router
- ✅ Server Side Rendering (SSR) - maybe a recap on how useEffect doesn't get called
- ✅ Code-splitting via Routes and Suspense

# Lecture

- Dashboard
- BrowseBoards
- Board

Teach the basics of React Router including:

- Switch
- Route
- Matching algo.
- useParams()
