- Demonstrate a sidebar that needs to visually hide/show when the viewport is bigger or smaller than 900px. If this is achieved with CSS Media Queries, the descendant components of the sidebar that have network side effects will run their effects even when the user can't see the sidebar. So we'll use this as a reason to do JS based media queries. See `.final`
