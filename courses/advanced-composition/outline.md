# Advanced Outline

## Overview

The advanced curriculum is approxamently one day's worth of material and teaches:

- Better, more composable API's (Compound Components)
- Advanced scenarios with context
- Advanced scenarios with events
- Advanced non-DOM related scenarios for `useRef`
- Proper aria usage (accessibility labeling)
- Advanced id management for accessibility
- Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components (For custom component APIs)

## Prerequisites

For taking our Advanced Workshop, attendees should:

- Be very comfortable with JSX and key concepts like props and state.
- Be very comfortable with making components from scratch.
- Be very comfortable with class-based lifecycles or alternatives techniques in hooks.
- Have some exposure to basic hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`.
- Have some exposure to `useReducer` and the reducer pattern.
- Have some exposure to React's context API.

In the very first lesson, before any lecture is given, we ask the attendee to build a component based on their existing React knowledge given a set of specifications. We assume you know how to do this given the list of prerequisites form above in order to be successful in our Advanced Workshop.
